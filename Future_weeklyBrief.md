### DM-UY 1143 B Ideation and Prototyping
##### Spring 2020 • Katherine Bennett • Mon/Wed 4:30PM-6:20PM • 2 MetroTech, Room 802

#### Semester Week 13 | Week 12: 

1. Address the weaknesses in your project, especially if I have alerted you to them.

2. Iterate and develop your Final presentation based on feedback from the class. Do the research that is going to develop and deepend your project. 

3. Iterate the message back, as need be.


#### Semester Week 12 | Week 11: 

1. Create a trial run of your final presentation to present in class this week. Make sure it does not exceed 4 minutes. Prepare your media, and practice it!

2. To prepare your presentation, not only (1) research the technqiues you are using, but (2) refine your content. (3) Connect your message to the presentation. (4) Ensure that your presentation gives us an idea, of what your world is like, and the current standing of the world. Work to connect all of these threads, in a creative, experimental context.

3. As such, develop and iterate your message back. It must be a specific message that comes from your future to our present. If you are at a loss, we can give you feedback on Wednesday

4. Iterate your Technical Manual/Guide. Add to and develop your Manual/Guide.

5. If you are struggling and have not iterated your story previously, revisit it and iterate/develop it. (Remember this class is about process. If your process is off, how are you dealing with that challenge? Are you ignoring it? Attending to it?, etc). This is a great stepping stone to drafting a final presentation (content as well as insights to techniques).


#### Semester Week 11 | Week 10: Take a Leap!

1. The final presentation that you are creating for your Future Project, must be from that future. Meaning, you can not be in this present and describe that future. You must be an element from that future, or a future further out. This includes media, objects, and people. 

I want to see you use what you have created thus far, for this project, as a launching pad into your Final. I am expecting you to be imaginative, experimental and risky.

In addition to the _method_ you are exploring, create the media used to deliver the information about this world.

*Research. Ideate. Prototype.* Show evidence of each of these three on your site for next week.


2. Develop and Refine your message back. Is it included directly in your final? It must be a specific message that comes from your future to our present.

3. Iterate your Technical Manual/Guide. Add to and develop your Manual/Guide.


4. Resolve your story.


#### Semester Week 10 | Week 9: The Turning Point

1. Resolve your story. Think about what your message back is (as of right now). How can you create a story that talks about that, while situated in your world? The story happens within your world, but it is not the tale of your world coming into existence.

2. Refine your message back. Remember you are sending information to the present day. Not vague or general advice. It is a piece of information. Solid information. What might someone need to know?

3. [Object: Create a DRAFT of a detailed technical manual and guide regarding how to use your object. What is your object for? How is it used? How is it cared for, repaired or maintained? What is sensitive or delicate about your object, that people need to be mindful of?](technicalManualGuide.md)

4. Brain storm ways to present your Future project. This is what will be presented in the final. This is to be a creative endeavor. Think about your world, story and message back. The presentation manner should apropos or fitting to the style of your world. You are invited to have fun and to be wildly imaginative here. Let yourself go and create a HUGE mindmap exploring the possibilities. Do not be limited by the size of the paper, or you will be surely disappointed with the process of creating this and be bored.



#### Semester Week 9 | Week 8: Storyboard 

1. Iterate and develop your storyboard. It must show evidence of your research and refinement of your story. 

2. What is your message back? Write a reflective post, outlining it.

3. Create a singular document of all of your sources, with annotations as to why they are of value to your project.

4. Finalize your timeline. Ensure that it fits within the [assignment brief](/narrative_timeline.md).


#### Semester Week 8 | Week 7: Future Project: Catch your breath. Reflect. Review:

1. Post what you have not from last week's deliverables (see below)

2. Prototype Object: an iteration of your object that is developed and/or refined. If you are not developing the low-fi prototype from last week, first do a detailed sketch of what this object is. This can be digital or physical prototype. This is ultimately **due March 29th.**

3. Develop your storyboard. Your story should show evidence of your research. This should be evident at multiple points

4. Prepare to present about your latest prototype in class next week. Be able to describe your world to us succintly (3-4 sentences). Then show us your object and tell us about your object. What is the significance of your object? What is it's function? You will have about 4 minutes to present this information to us. 

5. Review the personas assigned to you. See the slack announcement for your assignments.



#### Semester Week 7 | Week 6: Future Project: The Story Begins

1. Post the concept map(s) and Fill-in-the-Blank work from class. In a brief paragraph, discuss these developments. Also please post any previous work from class exercises (Day-in-the-life etc etc.) **Due March 22**

2. Create 4 [personas](https://github.com/IDMNYU/Ideation-Prototyping_Spring2020_Bennett/blob/master/Personas.md), one for each of for your prominent groups. This persona for the group, should be a symbolic member of that group. If your group is a minor, designated a spokesperson/conservatorship. **Due March 15**

3. Prototype Object: an iteration of your object that is developed and/or refined. If you are not developing the low-fi prototype from last week, first do a detailed sketch of what this object is. This can be digital or physical prototype. This is ultimately **due March 29th.**

4. Draft of your [Storyboard](https://github.com/IDMNYU/Ideation-Prototyping_Spring2020_Bennett/tree/master/storyboardTemplates). This is *not a summary of your timeline*. It is a more focused, down on the ground, story. This is from the view point of the people in your world. **Due March 22**
  - What are the challenges that your people struggle with? What are the contraints and problems? What comes in with a saving or destroying force?
  - Capture the critical segments in a particular window. Think of it as a major scene by major scene of your story (versus moment to moment). Think less about specific details and more about specific points within the story. [An example of major scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRyPSOyC7_c) versus the actual [story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyHNuVaZJ-k)


5. Annotated Bibliography additions: Research an analgous time in history, force (ie, company, scientific event, crisis), or object to inform and develop your story. **Due March 22**

6. Make additions and changes to your timeline as necessary **Due March 22**


#### Semester Week 6 | Week 5: Future Project: Prototype & Plot Thickening

* Annotated Bibliography - 5 new sources (different topics than last week). Look at your Headlines and Timeline. What there can be researched to add value & depth? Your plot should be thickening. What can give your story a twist? What is a major challenge to your world?

* Read [Module 9](http://teaching.polishedsolid.com/ip/mod9/content/index.html#/?_k=fuqopr) & Prototyping. Repeat the exercise in class: Sketch an item/tool/mechanism from your world. Spend 5 minutes giving visuals to this thing. Use paper and pen/pencil/marker. Fill up the paper with sketches of what this thing is, looks like, and how it works. Then repeat this process 3 times. After the 3 you created from class, you should have 6  different sketches total. These sketches should be at least 4 different items. You may iterate on 2 of them, should you wish.

* Develop one of the paper prototypes from the exercise in class and iterate upon it. Create and expand upon it on paper. Create a low-fi physical version. Document this on your process site with a description & reflection. What is the object and what is the significance?

* Storyline - create a post that describes the loose storyline that you are creating.

* Time Line - Develop your timeline to include your latest developments. Do another iteration. If the previous version was super rough, make this one more pleasing visually. 

* Identify 4-6 prominent people in your world, whether prominent in power, struggle, grief, success or strife. *These are not specific individuals* (ie, The President/Ruler, Bob Smith, etc). Rather a collection of people. Perhaps they hold a role; Perhaps they are found in a certain predicament, or group. These 4-6 are not from the same group, but different groups. *Ideally they have some connection to your object.*

#### Semester Week 5 | Week 4: Future Project: Dive Deeper

* Recap: Mind-mapping; concept mapping; card sorting; reflection

Revisit your ideation exercises thus far: mind-mapping, concept mapping, card sorting. What can be developed further? What topics are you interested in, that have gotten lost so far? Look over your previous exercises to see what "gold nuggets" lie within there, that need dusting off and exploring. Do additional mind-mapping and concept mapping to further explore each of these. (If you did not do a concept map previously, do a concept map with regard to your idea & or world).

This is important as this informs your research.

These do not need to be directly related to your idea. Remember that your ideas exists within your world. Your world is not solely nor strictly your idea. Rather, your world is larger than your idea. What else is going on in your world?

Write a reflection about what has developed after your ideation. How is your project developing?

* Headlines from the Future

What does a major newspaper front page look like, from your given world? Check out major national new sites(such as The New York Times, Washington Post, NPR, CNN, etc). Note the diversity of news stories, across the spectrum. Note that they are not all related to one topic (unless there is a severe crisis or huge "break" in the news). This diversity should exemplify the diversity of your world development. Think of this as snap shot of time. What all is going on with your world?

These are the gold nuggets (developed and formed from previous ideation exercises) to research and to develop into your story. Research these to add to your arsenal and bibliography.


* Moodboard

Create a visual moodboard that describes your world. This should be large, dense and diverse. Not cursory. This is a visual board of visual influences for your world. What does it look like? What things are you re-mixing from the past, that exist in this future? What are the visuals of this world? Colors? Urban areas? Rural areas?


* Annotated Bibliography - 4 new sources (different topics than last week)

Futher develop your annotated bibliography to have at least 4 additional sources. These sources must be topically diverse from your other sources. Discuss what they add to your story, as well as their relevance. 


* Time Line

Develop your timeline to include your latest developments. Do another iteration. If the previous version was super rough, make this one more pleasing visually. 


#### Semester Week 4 | Week 2: Future Project Ideation + World Development

* Create a post that is a written statement regarding what your Future project is going to be about. Where are you at the end of your card sorting? What sort of specific ideas arose from the interplay and ideation of your themes, descriptors and enabler cards?

* Develop the world that your future is. What is your future like? (pick at least 8 to incorporate into your world and write a post on your blog detailing this):
     > government <br>
  > living conditions <br>
   > health <br>
   > food <br>
   > economy<br>
   > climate<br>
   > shared values<br>
  > work conditions<br>
   >  communication<br>
   > information<br>
   > learning<br>
   > transportation<br>

* Identify Secondary topics, in addition to your Primary topics for your Future Narrative. Research (and be diverse with your research) these topics. What are some analogous times in history? What are some related discoveries in science, technology, medicine, etc? You can pull from these to inform your story. Begin an annotated bibliography, annotating what you have specifically gained from this source. 4 sources minimum.

* <a href = "narrative_timeline.md">Create a DRAFT timeline </a> for your Future Project thread of influences, beginning with the present through to your future. *How did this world come into being?* Evidence of your research should be present. This must be clear and readable on your blog.

Read [Module 4](http://teaching.polishedsolid.com/ip/mod4/content/index.html#/?_k=drjxy8)

Read [Module 9 : Narrative Thread of Influences](http://teaching.polishedsolid.com/ip/mod9/content/index.html#/?_k=gsjmzc)



#### Semester Week 3 | Week 1: Future Project Launch

Read [Module 8](http://teaching.polishedsolid.com/ip/mod8/content/index.html#/?_k=6m31cj)

Create each of the following with regard to the final project, and post to your process site under your Future tab:

* clear visual documentation of the Card Sorting exercise on your process site, along with a written reflection on 3 outcomes that were generated.
* Generate at 2 Mind Maps, further exploring 2 of the possible stories. Go deep and let your mind explore these topics. What else could be explored here? What is related? Post the visuals to your blog along with a written reflection about what was generated and what is developing.

* Take key discoveries that you are gravitating towards from your mind maps, and further explore those explicitly and more deeply through concept maps. Explore the relationships and meanings behind these concepts. This should be larger, explorative and thoughtful.
Post the visuals to your blog along with a written reflection about what was generated and how things have developed.
* Began researching and collecting materials for your Future Project.
