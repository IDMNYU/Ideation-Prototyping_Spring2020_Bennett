# Narrative Timeline of Influences

*Make sure you watch <a href="http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series" target="_blank">Everything Is A Remix</a> before embarking on this assignment.*

As research for your future utopia / dystopia project, create an evolution timeline by making one of the following:

*   an infographic as a pdf (post on your process website) **OR** 
*	another video documentary 1 to 3 minutes in length, post on vimeo or youtube, and embed on your process website **OR** 
*	an interactive data visualization and embed within your process website.

The timeline should reflect:
* your world and the diversity of activity within it; this relates to your framing story or message for your future Dystopia / Utopia project 
* It should not be strictly the story nor solely the subject matter of your story. 
* It should include information about secondary topics (see week 2 for this project in the project briefing) 

The timeline should contain **at least** 3 iterations if not more. Each iteration should demonstrate content development, as well as design development.

Post the timeline to your Process site
